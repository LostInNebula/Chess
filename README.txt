•How to compile:
    - javac each file in the folder, i.e. (javac Rook.java, javac Fen.java, javac Board.java, etc)

•Any assumptions
    - it is assumed the user will input their moves EXACTLY as requested, one at a time and as an integer
    
•Any known bugs or defects in the program
    - cause is unknown but on occasion some pieces will refuse to cross rows 3 and 4

Piece.java, Fen.java, and Pawn.java were all provided to me and I take no credit for them.
